# Covariance vs Correlation: Understanding Relationships in Data

*A Complete Guide to Measuring Relationships Between Variables*

Imagine trying to understand if there's a connection between two things in life, for example:
- Does studying more hours lead to better exam scores?

In data science, we constantly ask: "How do these two variables relate to each other?" That's where covariance and correlation come in as our essential tools for measuring and understanding relationships between variables.

This notebook walks you through the differences between covariance and correlation, with practical examples.

## Topics Covered

**Covariance** 
- Definition and formula
- Multiple calculation methods
- Limitations

**Correlation** 
- **Pearson Correlation** - for linear relationships
- **Spearman Correlation** - for monotonic relationships
- Multiple calculation methods
- Interpretation guidelines
- Limitations of each type


## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone this repository

# Install required packages
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy

# Open the notebook and start exploring!
```

## Key Takeaways
- **Covariance:** Shows direction but hard to interpret strength (range: -∞ to +∞)
- **Correlation:** Shows both direction and strength, standardized (range: -1 to +1)
- **Pearson:** Best for linear relationships, sensitive to outliers
- **Spearman:** Best for monotonic relationships, robust to outliers
